# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction
Developed a machine learning-based web application to predict future stock prices using historical market data. Implemented algorithms such as LSTM, Linear Regression, and Simple Moving Average (SMA) to analyze trends and forecast stock performance. The model was trained and tested on real-time datasets to improve accuracy. The application was deployed on Vercel, providing users with an interactive interface to visualize predictions and compare stock movements over time.
